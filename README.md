# Sorting Algorithms in Python

Some sorting algorithms implemented in Python.

## What is This?

In this repository, I compiled some some sorting algorithms implemented in Python. This repository doesn't have anything new, per say. I coded this with two purposes: the first one is self improvement and the second one is to offer a single place where sorting algorithms implementations and details can be accessed.

## Usage

`python sorting.py number_of_elements sorting_strategy`

`number_of_elements` is a positive integer that specifies the number of values that the list to be sorted will have.

`sorting_strategy` is the sorting algorithm that will be used and can be one of the following:

* bubble
* quick
