# Sorting Algorithms in Python

Some sorting algorithms implemented in Python.

## What is This?

In this repository, I compiled some some sorting algorithms and implemented them in Python. I did this for practicing purposes. Several other algorithms are yet to be implemented.

## Usage

`python sorting.py number_of_elements sorting_strategy`

`number_of_elements` is a positive integer that specifies the number of values that the list to be sorted will have.

`sorting_strategy` is the sorting algorithm that will be used and can be one of the following:

* bubble
* quick
* selection

## Built With

* [Python 3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/)

## Algorithms Implemented So Far

* [Bubble Sort](https://cdtpinto.github.io/pages/sorting#bubble-sort)

* [Quick Sort](https://cdtpinto.github.io/pages/sorting#quick-sort)

* [Selection Sort](https://cdtpinto.github.io/pages/sorting#selection-sort)
